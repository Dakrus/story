                %p.q-title What’s the refund/cancellation policy?
                %p We want to help you get the most out of your ticket purchase, and we just need to be able to anticipate how many people will be at each Workshop. So if you are unable to attend your class for any reason, you may have someone substitute for your participation in the program.  Just please contact us at least 5 days before your Workshop is scheduled to take place.
                %p If you are unable to attend and can’t find a substitute, contact us and we will convert your ticket into a non-refundable credit that you can apply toward any educational products or events for up to one year from your original event date. Some restrictions may apply. Classes are subject to cancellation and date/time changes, however we will do our best to apprise all attendees in the unlikely event that any changes to the Workshop schedule need to be made.
              .question
                %p.q-title What does it mean if the venue for my class says TBD?
                %p Some workshop venues are still being confirmed, and this information will be updated o our website just as soon as those venues are confirmed.  We will also be informing all registrants by email of their workshop’s venue, time, etc. before the actual class. As a general note most of the venues will be hotel banquet rooms, and Classroom Session and Master Classes in each city will primarily take place in the same venue as eachother as well.
              .question
                %p.q-title What do I need to get into the classes?
                %p Please bring your confirmation email, which contains your workshop ticket, with you to the class.  Your ticket may be used for more than one person if you purchased multiple tickets at one time.

                %P “Audio is as important if not more important than video and if you don't know what you are doing in that area all your hard work with the image is wasted. Adam breaks down everything you need to know into understandable, coherent sections …which will leave you much the wiser, more confident and ready to record great sound! He is a fantastic teacher who clearly loves what he teaches and that comes across making it a pleasure to listen to!”
